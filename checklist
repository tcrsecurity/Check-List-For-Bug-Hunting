live Hunting Session




Suggestions:


 >>>>> Try to get urls (endpoint) as much as you can
 >>>>> 




1. Some common bugs:


   > Open redirect
   > Username Enumeration
   > Exif geolocation not stripped
   > HTTP in login or registration
   > Failer to invalidate session after password change 
   > NO rate limiting
   > WAF Bypass
   > Lack of password confirmation on delete account
   > Zone transfer
   > Using default creds or register with @company.com
   > Sensitive Data Exposure
   > this test case 


2. Authentication Testing:

   > 2FA Bypass
   > OTP Brute Force
   > Password Reset logic
   > Write it here


3. Oauth2.0 Bugs:

   > Oauth Login CSRF
   > Connect CSRF
   > Redirect URI
   > Pre Account Takeover


4. JWT Bugs:

   > Unverified Signature
   > None Algorithm Accepted
   > HS256 alg can be bruteforced


5. Broken Access Controls:

   > Always check sensitive URLs and try to access them
   > Try to understand JavaScript Even you donot know javascript just try see , may be you find something intresting
   > If you find app is using admin=true or 1 and admin=false or 0 then alway try exploit it
   > Sometimes application is leaking data in redirect
   > Check for IDOR if application is using ID params for accessing users data
   > If GET method is not working try other methods vice-versa
   > If application is using multi step, try to exploit every step.


6. Server Side Request Forgery ( SSRF )
 
   > SSRF against local system both 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.0.1
   > SSRF against blacklist bypass filter
   > SSRF to XSS 
   > SSRF to Remote Code Execution
   > SSRF to Port Scanning
   > SSRF to metadata


7.  Directory Traversal 

   > Simple check
   > dot dot slash
   > Double dot dot slash
   > Encoding and bypass techniqes
   > NUll Byte for bypass
   > Automation (dotdotpwn and lfisuite)


8. Cross Origin Resourece Sharing 

   > Simple case 
   > NUll Origin accepting
   > Subdomain Accepting


9. Host Header Attacks

   > Try to access (127.0.0.1 or 192.168.0.1)
   > Password reset 
   > Cache Poisoning


10. Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

   > Simple XSS
   > Encoding
   > Payload Fixing (AI)
   > POST Based XSS to reflected XSS
   > Automation


11. Cross Site Request Forgery
   
   > simple csrf
   > Request method change 
   > CSRF token reuse and remove and others
   > Brute force csrf token


12. Command Injection

   > Command Chaining Operators ; & | || &&
   > sleep 10
   > nslookup burp_collab
   

13. File Upload bugs

   > Check filename bypass
   > Check Content-Type 
   > Chekc file content type bypass
   > Path traversal to other dir
   > Encoding


14. XXE (XML External Entiry) Injection
   
   > change json to xml
   > XXE to lfi
   > XXE to ssrf meta-data 
   > XXE to ssrf auth by pass
   > XXE out of band techniqu



15. Web Sockets Hacking

   > We can input validation bugs
   > XSS
   > Web Socket Hijacking
   

16. AWS Pentesting

   > S3 bucket listing to everyone
   > S3 bucket listing to authenticated user
   > S3 Bucket delete
   > Object delete on S3 bucket
   > File upload on S3 bucket
   > Keys in js file try to configure AWS cli
   > AWS account then try to find user details
   > Try to find snapshots or other details


17. Subdomain Takeover 

   > Github takeover
   > AWS takeover
   > Azure takeover
   > others
   > https://godiego.co/posts/STO-Azure/
   > https://github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz


18. SQL Injection
   > 



19. GraphQL API bugs

   > Detecting GraphQL
   > Introspection is on or off
   > If on then fetch data and use http://nathanrandal.com/graphql-visualizer/ and https://graphql-kit.com/graphql-voyager/
   > Try to find sensitive data and IDOR 
   > If off then manualy browse the app try to understand the app from error
   > Check for SQL Injection
